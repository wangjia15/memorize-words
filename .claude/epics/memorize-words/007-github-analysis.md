## Dependency Mapping

```
Stream A (Core Engine) → Stream B (Session Management) → Stream C (Frontend Interface)
    ↓                           ↓                          ↓
  Entities                  Services                   Components
  Algorithms               Controllers                Hooks
  Repositories              DTOs                       Pages
```

## Integration Points

### Cross-Stream Dependencies
