# Epic: memorize-words

## Overview

Implementation of a modern vocabulary learning application using Spring Boot 3.x with server-side rendering (Thymeleaf) and shadcn UI components. The system will feature scientific spaced repetition algorithms, comprehensive progress tracking, and a responsive design optimized for efficient word memorization across desktop and mobile devices.

## Architecture Decisions

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Thymeleaf templates with shadcn UI components for consistent, accessible UI
- **Spring Boot 3.x**: Latest framework features including improved observability and AOT compilation support
- **Database Strategy**: MySQL 8.0 with optimized schema for vocabulary storage and user progress tracking
- **Security Framework**: Spring Security 6.x for authentication/authorization with session-based management
- **Caching Layer**: Spring Cache abstraction with Redis/Caffeine for frequently accessed vocabulary data
- **Build System**: Maven for dependency management and build automation
- **Component Integration**: Custom CSS/JS integration layer for shadcn components with Thymeleaf

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components
- **shadcn UI Integration**: Custom build process to integrate shadcn components with Thymeleaf templates
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS utility classes with shadcn responsive breakpoints
- **Interactive Elements**: Card flip animations, progress bars, and form validation using shadcn components
- **State Management**: Server-side session state with minimal client-side JavaScript for UI interactions
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through shadcn's accessible component design

### Backend Services
- **Authentication Service**: Spring Security with custom UserDetailsService and password encoding
- **Vocabulary Service**: CRUD operations for word management, custom lists, and built-in dictionaries
- **Learning Service**: Spaced repetition algorithm implementation with configurable difficulty adjustments
- **Progress Service**: Statistics calculation, streak tracking, and performance analytics
- **Data Models**: JPA entities for User, Word, VocabularyList, LearningRecord, and ReviewSession

### Infrastructure
- **Database Schema**: Optimized MySQL design with proper indexing for large vocabulary datasets
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for vocabulary data, user sessions, and computed statistics
- **Performance Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator with custom metrics for learning effectiveness
- **Deployment**: Containerized Spring Boot application with MySQL database
- **Static Assets**: Efficient serving of shadcn CSS/JS bundles with proper versioning

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Phases
1. **Foundation Phase** (2 weeks): Project setup, Spring Boot configuration, database schema, basic shadcn integration
2. **Authentication Phase** (1 week): User registration/login with Spring Security, profile management
3. **Core Learning Phase** (3 weeks): Vocabulary management, learning interface, basic review functionality
4. **Algorithm Phase** (1.5 weeks): Spaced repetition implementation, progress tracking
5. **Enhancement Phase** (0.5 weeks): Statistics visualization, UI polish, performance optimization

### Risk Mitigation
- **shadcn Integration Risk**: Create proof-of-concept early to validate Thymeleaf compatibility
- **Performance Risk**: Implement database pagination and caching from the start
- **User Experience Risk**: Conduct usability testing with shadcn components during development

### Testing Approach
- **Unit Tests**: Service layer testing with MockMvc for controller endpoints
- **Integration Tests**: Spring Boot test slices for repository and security testing
- **UI Tests**: Selenium tests for critical user journeys with shadcn components
- **Performance Tests**: JMeter load testing for concurrent user scenarios
