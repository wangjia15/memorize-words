## Dependency Mapping

```
Stream A (Caching) → Stream D (Testing)
Stream B (Database) → Stream D (Testing)
Stream C (Monitoring) → Stream D (Testing)
Stream B → Stream A (Database metrics inform caching strategy)
Stream A → Stream C (Cache performance monitoring)
```

## Integration Points

### Cross-Stream Dependencies
1. **Stream A → Stream B**: Cache effectiveness depends on database performance
2. **Stream B → Stream C**: Database queries need performance monitoring
3. **Stream A → Stream D**: Cache performance testing requires cache implementation
4. **Stream B → Stream D**: Database performance testing requires optimized queries
5. **Stream C → Stream D**: Monitoring data needed for test validation

### Shared Components
- Performance metrics collection and reporting
- Configuration management for all performance components
- Test data management and environment setup
- Deployment and monitoring coordination

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Streams A, B, C)
1. Implement caching infrastructure
2. Optimize database queries and indexing
3. Set up performance monitoring
4. Establish performance baselines

### Phase 2: Integration (All Streams)
1. Integrate caching with optimized database
2. Connect monitoring to all components
3. Develop comprehensive testing framework
4. Validate performance improvements

### Phase 3: Validation (Stream D focus)
1. Execute performance and load testing
2. Validate monitoring effectiveness
3. Optimize based on test results
4. Prepare for production deployment
