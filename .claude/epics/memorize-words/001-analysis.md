# Task 001 Analysis: Project Foundation Setup

## Task Overview
- **Task**: 001 - Project Foundation Setup
- **Title**: Project Foundation Setup
- **Effort**: 8 points
- **Status**: Ready to start
- **Parallel**: true (no dependencies)

## Current State Assessment
The task is in `pending` status with no blocking dependencies. Based on the existing worktree and codebase analysis, there appears to be some foundational work already completed, but the task requirements specify comprehensive Spring Boot 3.x setup with shadcn/ui integration.

## Parallel Work Streams Identified

### Stream A: Backend Foundation (Agent-1)
**Scope**: Spring Boot 3.x project setup, configuration, and core infrastructure
**Files to work with**:
- `pom.xml` or build configuration
- `src/main/java/com/memorizewords/MemorizeWordsApplication.java`
- `src/main/resources/application.yml`
- `src/main/java/com/memorizewords/config/` (configuration classes)
- `src/main/java/com/memorizewords/controller/HealthController.java`
- `src/main/java/com/memorizewords/exception/GlobalExceptionHandler.java`

**Key deliverables**:
- Spring Boot 3.x project structure
- Maven/Gradle build configuration with essential dependencies
- Application properties for different environments
- Health check endpoint
- Global exception handling
- Basic project structure following Spring Boot conventions

### Stream B: Frontend Integration (Agent-2)
**Scope**: shadcn/ui setup, frontend structure, and build integration
**Files to work with**:
- Frontend directory structure
- `package.json` configuration
- shadcn/ui component setup
- Build tool configuration (Vite/Webpack)
- Development server setup
- Static asset serving from Spring Boot

**Key deliverables**:
- shadcn/ui component library setup
- React/TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Build tool configuration
- Development environment setup
- Frontend build integration with Spring Boot

## Coordination Requirements

### Integration Points
1. **Static Asset Serving**: Backend needs to serve frontend static files
2. **CORS Configuration**: Backend must be configured for frontend development
3. **Build Process**: Frontend build artifacts need to be accessible to Spring Boot
4. **Development Environment**: Both streams must coordinate on development server setup

### Communication Protocol
- Use the existing `.claude/epics/memorize-words/updates/001/` directory for progress tracking
- Create `stream-A.md` and `stream-B.md` files for individual stream progress
- Coordinate through the execution-status.md file for overall task status

## Success Criteria
- Application starts successfully on localhost:8080
- Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- Frontend builds without errors
- Development and production profiles configured
- All tests pass
- Code follows project conventions and standards

## Risk Mitigation
- **Integration Risk**: Coordinate early on static asset serving strategy
- **Configuration Risk**: Validate Spring Boot 3.x compatibility with all dependencies
- **Build Risk**: Establish clear build process for both frontend and backend components

## Next Steps
Launch both parallel agents to work on their respective streams simultaneously, with coordination through the shared worktree and progress tracking files.
