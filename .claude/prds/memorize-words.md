# PRD: memorize-words

## Executive Summary

The memorize-words application is a modern vocabulary learning platform built on Spring Boot 3.x framework with server-side rendering using Thymeleaf and shadcn UI components. The application focuses on efficient word memorization through scientific algorithms and diverse learning modes, providing users with a streamlined and engaging learning experience.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Traditional vocabulary learning methods lack scientific memorization algorithms and modern, intuitive user interfaces. Existing solutions often have poor user experience, inconsistent UI components, and ineffective retention strategies.

**Why is this important now?**
- Growing demand for effective language learning tools
- Need for modern, responsive web applications using latest Spring Boot 3.x features
- Opportunity to leverage shadcn UI for consistent, accessible component design
- Scientific approach to spaced repetition can significantly improve learning outcomes

## User Stories

### Primary User Personas
1. **Language Learners**: Students studying foreign languages who need systematic vocabulary building
2. **Professional Learners**: Working professionals preparing for certification exams or improving technical vocabulary
3. **Self-Directed Learners**: Individuals seeking to expand their general vocabulary knowledge

### Detailed User Journeys

**As a new user, I want to:**
- Register and create an account with Spring Security authentication
- Browse available vocabulary libraries organized by difficulty and topic
- Start learning with a simple, intuitive interface

**As a regular learner, I want to:**
- Set daily learning goals using intuitive slider controls
- Learn new words with definitions, phonetics, and example sentences
- Mark words as "known" or "unknown" for personalized learning paths
- Add personal notes to words for better retention

**As a reviewing user, I want to:**
- Access words due for review based on scientific spacing algorithms
- Practice with multiple review modes (recognition, spelling, difficulty rating)
- Track my learning progress and accuracy statistics
- View visual representations of my learning trends

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Learning Features**
- User registration/authentication via Spring Security 6.x
- Vocabulary library management with CRUD operations
- Interactive word learning interface with shadcn card components
- Spaced repetition system based on Ebbinghaus forgetting curve
- Multiple review modes (card flip, spelling practice, difficulty marking)
- Personal note-taking functionality for each word
- Custom vocabulary list creation and management

**Progress Tracking**
- Daily learning goal setting and tracking
- Comprehensive learning statistics and visualizations
- Achievement system with badges and streak counters
- Learning trend analysis with Chart.js integration

**Data Management**
- Word import/export functionality
- Built-in vocabulary databases
- User preference and settings management
- Learning history and performance analytics

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Expectations**
- Page load times under 1.5 seconds
- Smooth UI interactions and transitions
- Efficient database queries with caching strategies
- Responsive design across all device types

**Security Considerations**
- Secure user authentication with Spring Security 6.x
- Data encryption for sensitive user information
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
- Secure API endpoints with proper authorization

**Scalability Needs**
- Support for multiple concurrent users
- Efficient database design for large vocabulary sets
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Modular architecture for future feature expansion

**Technology Stack**
- Backend: Spring Boot 3.x with JDK 17+
- Frontend: Thymeleaf + shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS
- Database: MySQL 8.0
- Security: Spring Security 6.x
- Build Tool: Maven/Gradle
- Visualization: Chart.js for statistics

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes**
- User engagement: Average session duration > 15 minutes
- Learning effectiveness: 80%+ word retention rate after 1 week
- User satisfaction: 4.5+ star rating in user feedback
- Performance: <1.5s page load times, >95% uptime

**Key Metrics and KPIs**
- Daily active users and retention rate
- Words learned per user per session
- Review completion rates and accuracy
- Time spent in learning vs. review modes
- User-generated content (custom word lists, notes)

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Limitations**
- Must use Spring Boot 3.x and maintain compatibility with JDK 17+
- Server-side rendering with Thymeleaf (no SPA framework)
- shadcn UI component library integration requirements
- MySQL database platform constraints

**Timeline Constraints**
- P0 features to be delivered in Phase 1 (8 weeks)
- P1 features in Phase 2 (additional 6 weeks)
- P2 features in Phase 3 (future roadmap)

**Resource Limitations**
- Single full-stack developer initially
- Budget constraints for external APIs (pronunciation, translation)
- Hosting limitations for initial deployment

**Assumptions**
- Users have modern browsers supporting ES6+ features
